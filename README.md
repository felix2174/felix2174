# Hi, I'm Jörg 👋

**Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung** | Building the future with AI, one commit at a time.

I'm a Junior Developer from 🇩🇪 Germany with a passion for **AI infrastructure** and **web development**. I build tools that make autonomous AI agents safer and more reliable.

### 🔥 What I'm Working On

- 🛡️ [**ClawGuard**](https://github.com/felix2174/clawguard) — A security firewall for AI agents. Detects prompt injections, code obfuscation & social engineering. Battle-tested through 5 rounds of AI Red Teaming.
- 🤖 **Buddy** — My personal autonomous AI agent, running on my own VPS. I built custom tools, security hardening, and automated workflows around him.
- 🏢 [**Day2Day-Manager**](https://github.com/felix2174/Day2Day-Manager) — A full-stack project management tool built with Laravel, featuring MOCO API integration, real-time dashboards, and team capacity tracking.
